    <h1>Wainwright's Emporium</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section class="section-container">     
        <img class="left-pic" src="Assets\images\hackney1 1.png" alt="an image two horses pulling a carriage full of passengers. the carriage is traveling down a rain soaked cobbled street">
        <p>The cobbled street is bathed in the soft glow of gas lamps. A recent rain caused them to shimmer. The clop of the horse’s hooves and the clatter of the wheels on your rented hackney keep a constant tempo as they carry you to your destination.</p>
        <p>Soon, the steady rhythm of your journey slows and then ceases. You’ve reached your stop. With slightly shaking fingers, you open the door of the hackney. In the opposite hand, you hold the mysterious artifact that has brought you here.</p>
        <p>Behind you, there are surprised gasps as your fellow passengers notice where your destination ends. Some make the sign of a cross across their bosom. Their reaction causes more dread to fill you.</p>
        <p>You glance at the three-story corner shop as your feet touch the sidewalk. Glancing up at the sign hanging above the entrance of the building, you read, “Wainwright’s Emporium.” This is the place.</p>
        <p>With a terse bid goodnight from the hackney driver, he pulled away. Murmurs from inside the carriage followed in its wake. As Big Ben chimes the late hour, you’re having second thoughts. Why Mr. Wainwright wanted to meet at the ‘witching hour’ seems even more questionable.</p>
        <img class="right-pic" src="Assets\images\Wainwrightshop.png" alt="the image of a three-story victorian shop with large windows on the ground floor">
        <p>As the last distant chime sounds, the front door of the emporium opens. You realize it’s too late to tuck tail and run as a tall, thin, middle-aged man steps onto the sidewalk. His mustache twitches as if he knows your inner thoughts. With a wave of a hand and a “Welcome, my friend,” he beckons you inside. His intonation is strong, yet the volume is low. “Come inside,” he bids and stands aside to make room for you to enter.</p>
        <p>The door shuts behind you with a cheerful tinkle of a bell. The sound of a lock turning is less friendly. You can’t help the shudder that runs up your spine.</p>
        <p>You turn to look at the shop owner. “We wouldn’t want to be disturbed,” Mr. Wainwright explains. Although it’s a reasonable statement, you can’t help but feel even less at ease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wainwright leads you to a rectangular counter in the center of the first floor. Its surface is covered with various antiquities. Opening a small swinging door, the emporium’s proprietor walks behind the counter and clears off a spot for your artifact. His ice-blue gaze then meets yours in expectation. “What intriguing treasure have you brought me this night?” he asks.</p>
        <p>Reaching out your hand, you place the haunted item on the cleared spot on the counter. It is:</p>
